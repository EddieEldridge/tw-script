{IsengardEmmisary_gov}Isengard Inquisitor
{IsengardEmmisary_gov_desc}This man is an Isengard Inquisitor, sent to Dunland to keep the unruly population in check and to ensure that they remain loyal to the interests of Isengard. He is a stern and efficient enforcer, feared by many of the locals for his ruthless tactics and unforgiving nature. He wears the White Hand of Isengard proudly and bears the authority of Saruman himself, ready to do whatever it takes to maintain order and crush any dissent.
{IsengardEmmisary_gov_effects_desc}TBD
¬--------------------
{IsengardEmmisary_battle}Isengard Inquisitor
{IsengardEmmisary_battle_desc}This Isengard Inquisitor is a hardened veteran of countless battles, who has come to Dunland to aid in their war efforts. His grim demeanour and ruthless tactics make him a fearsome sight on the battlefield. He is known to instil fear and discipline in the ranks of Dunlending warriors, and his presence alone can turn the tide of a battle. His ultimate goal is to help the Dunlendings emerge victorious in their struggle against Rohan, and to establish Isengard's dominance over the region.
{IsengardEmmisary_battle_effects_desc}TBD
¬--------------------
{Right_gov_dunland}Right Governor
{Right_gov_dunland_desc}This trait represents a leader who shares the same ethnicity as the people they are ruling over. When a matching governor is installed, the population is more likely to be content with their leadership, as they feel understood and represented by their governor. \n\nIt is important to carefully consider the ethnicity of the governor when assigning them to rule over a settlement. A mismatched governor can lead to unrest and rebellion, while a matching governor can provide stability and contentment among the people.
{Right_gov_dunland_effects_desc}+25% Public Order, +2% Tax Income, -5% Unit Training Costs
¬--------------------
{Wrong_gov_dunland}Wrong Governor
{Wrong_gov_dunland_desc}The "Wrong Governor" trait represents the dissatisfaction felt by the population of a settlement when they are ruled by a leader who does not share their politics. This can lead to unrest and rebellion, as the people feel oppressed by a leader who does not understand or care about their culture. \n\nIt is important to carefully consider the ethnicity of the governor when assigning them to rule over a settlement. A mismatched governor can lead to unrest and rebellion, while a matching governor can provide stability and contentment among the people.

{Wulfingir}Wulfingir
{Wulfingir_desc}This man belongs to the Wulfingir, the proud and powerful tribal nobility of Dunland. They are the native-born rulers of their land, claiming descent from the great warrior Wulf, who fought and conquered his enemies with ferocity and cunning. The Wulfingir are fiercely independent and value their heritage above all else, seeking to preserve their traditional way of life and protect their land from all who would threaten it. Should this man prove himself worthy, he may ascend to the position of Gurach and lead his people as a true chieftain. His status as a Wulfingir makes him a "proper" ruler in the eyes of his kin, and his authority will be respected by all who acknowledge the power of Dunlending nobility. He is likely to be seen as a symbol of strength and stability, and his rule will be accepted more readily by newly integrated populations. \n\nAs a true Dunlending, he is a skilled and fearsome warrior, fighting with a ferocity and determination that comes from years of inter-tribal warfare and bloody raids on neighbouring lands. His experience on the battlefield makes him a competent and capable leader of infantry, able to inspire and command his troops with confidence and skill. Overall, the Wulfingir are a powerful and respected force within Dunlending society, and their rule is feared and respected by all who would challenge their authority.

¬--------------------
{Frekkalingir}Frekkalingir
{Frekkalingir_desc}This man is of the Frekkalingir, a unique group in Dunland that claims descent from Freca's Rohirric retainers. Though not considered part of the native nobility of the Wulfingir, the Frekkalingir still hold a high position in Dunlending society, with their power deriving not from clan-bonds and tribal relations, but solely from their loyalty to the ruling Gurach. This man is a skilled horseman, having grown up riding heavily-armoured steeds that are rare and highly valued in Dunland. \n\nHis mixed heritage, however, may pose a challenge to his rule, as all  proper Dunlendings view the Frekkalingir with suspicion due to their partially Rohirric heritage. This may lead to unrest and opposition to his leadership, especially if he were to become Gurach. Despite this, he can still draw on his unique perspective to navigate the complex political landscape of Dunland, and his familiarity with commanding other riders in battle makes him a valuable asset to any army he leads.

¬--------------------
{Dunforgoil}Dunforgoil
{Dunforgoil_desc}This man belongs to the Dunforgoil, a half-blood population born from the union of Rohirrim and Dunlendings. Their existence is a testament to the complex and often hostile relationship between these two peoples. The Dunforgoil are a proud and fierce people, possessing both the courage and skill of the Rohirrim and the cunning and tenacity of the Dunlendings. They fight on horseback, a skill that sets them apart from their pure-blooded Dunlending kin. But there is a deep hatred that runs between the Dunlendings and the Rohirrim, a feud that stretches back many years. The Dunlendings have long resented the Rohirrim for taking their lands, and this hatred has only grown. \n\nThis hatred is particularly strong among the pure-blooded Dunlendings, who see the Dunforgoil as a reminder of their loss and humiliation. The Dunforgoil themselves often struggle with their dual heritage, torn between their loyalty to the Dunlending clans and their ties to Rohan. This man, as a Dunforgoil, possesses the traits of both peoples. He is a skilled horseman and a formidable warrior, feared by his enemies and respected by his kin. But his position is not without peril. If he were to ascend to the position of Gurach, ruler of the Dunlending clans, he would have to navigate the treacherous waters of Dunlending politics, where the hatred for the Rohirrim runs deep and the spectre of civil war looms always on the horizon. In battle, this man fights with the fury of the Dunlendings and the honour of the Rohirrim.

¬--------------------
{Isendraich}Isendraich
{Isendraich_desc}This man is of the Isendraich, a tribe with roots that stretch back to the garrison of Isengard. His bloodline is a blend of Dunnish and other influences, and he has grown up in an environment that values discipline, cunning and strength. As such, he is a skilled leader and strategist on the battlefield, and will bring a measure of order to any settlement under his command. However, the Isendraich have long been seen as outsiders by other Dunlending tribes, and there are many who resent their presence and influence. \n\nIf this man were to rise to the position of Gurach, the tension between the Isendraich and the rest of Dunlending society could boil over into open conflict, resulting in a civil war that could tear the realm apart. Despite his abilities as a ruler, his background may cause him to be viewed with suspicion by some, making it difficult for him to gain the trust and loyalty of all those he seeks to govern.

{Ring_Wearer}In Possession of the One Ring
{Ring_Wearer_desc}This general is in control of the One Ring. As the one who possesses the One Ring, this general has gained an immense amount of power and influence. With the Ring under their control, they are able to exert their will upon others and command great respect and fear. However, the Ring also corrupts its bearer, tempting them with promises of ultimate power and domination, and twisting their thoughts and desires towards darkness. While the Ring grants great strength and abilities, it also puts its bearer in grave danger and makes them vulnerable to attack from their enemies.

{Brego}Biography
{Brego_desc}Brego was born to a Dunlending father and a Rohirric mother, making him a member of the Dunforgoil. Growing up, he experienced the tension between the two cultures first hand and often felt like an outsider in both worlds. He was drawn to the Rohirric way of life, with its emphasis on honour, bravery, and horsemanship, but also felt a deep loyalty to his Dunlending kin.\n\nAs he grew older, Brego became increasingly disillusioned with the Dunlending way of life. He saw the violence and hatred that consumed his people and felt that it was leading them nowhere. Meanwhile, he was drawn to the Rohirrim's way of life, which seemed to offer a path to a better future.\n\nWhen the Rohirrim conquered Dunland and began to establish their rule, Brego saw an opportunity to forge a new path for himself. He betrayed his Dunlending kin and pledged his loyalty to Rohan, hoping to gain power and status under their rule. His Rohirric heritage and horsemanship skills made him a valuable asset to the Rohirrim, and he quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nEventually, Brego was appointed governor of the town of Bregnas, a position that gave him significant power and influence over the local Dunlending population. He continued to play both sides, appearing to be a loyal Rohirrim while secretly manipulating the Dunlendings for his own gain. He justified his betrayal by telling himself that he was working to bring peace and stability to the region, but deep down, he knew that he had abandoned his own people for personal gain.

{ElvenRace}Elf
{ElvenRace_desc}The Elves were the firstborn, created by Eru and given the gift of unending life, they first awoke on the shores of Cuiviénen in the far east many thousands of years ago. They are the wisest of all creatures and perhaps the most universally talented, skilled in all arts they devote their time to; indeed the best warriors, smiths, archers, riders, poets, musicians and craftsmen were all Elves. Over the many years they have grown weary of Middle-earth and many are leaving to live their immortal lives on the shores of far off Aman, also known as Valinor. All Elves are gifted with keen sight, a swiftness of movement unmatched by the other races but they are notably more frail than humans or dwarves. The oldest remaining elf who features prominently in the war against Sauron is Círdan the Shipwright who dwells in Mithlond; he awoke with the very first of the firstborn all those years ago...

{HobbitRace}Hobbit
{HobbitRace_desc}Hobbits are stunted race of humanoids who inhabit the peaceful lands of the Shire, they are not aggressive by nature, they actively avoid war, have a love of all nature and enjoy the simple things in life. The love of their homeland and many years of witnessing the ways of the world has lead the Hobbits to be deeply mistrustful of outsiders and they seldom venture beyond the borders of their homeland. The Hobbits started out life in the east and like all the races, they migrated west, eventually settling in the lands of the Gladden fields and the Anduin Vale thus developing a close link with the Éothéod giving rise to many similarities in Hobbit and Rohirric culture. For unknown reasons, at the start of the Third Age many Hobbits began their migration even further west across the mountains, those that remained became the Stoors and it is from them that Gollum finds life. They settled first in the lands of the Dunlendings and in the Angle to the north, then they moved further still to the lands of the Weather-Hills until finally, two Fallohide brothers lead them across the Brandywine and the Shire was founded. They allowed the Last King of Arnor to claim lordship over them as the Shire was actually in Arnor but they maintained their independence and upon the fall of Arnor, they elected a Thain to ceremoniously govern the Shire. The Thain had control over the ranks of Hobbitry-in-Arms and also the Shire Moot but as the Shire rarely got embroiled in affairs of the world, the Thain was merely a formality. The peace of the Shire has endured many hardships but now that Sauron rises, the Hobbits know nothing of him and they are blissfully unaware of the perils they face, or at least Saruman thought so until their strength was finally revealed and the Shire was saved once and for all by the four wanderers.

Whilst some of the Middlemen do fight for the shadow, they are not truly under its sway and would fight for their own independence should Sauron claim ultimate victory.

They are a wild breed, less sophisticated than their kinfolk that heeded the Valar, and they are jealous guardians of their hidden places. Men that do try to cross the threshold are found cut, or feathered by long-shafted gracile arrows. The Avari are not interested in becoming part of any realm, nor will they be subjects of any lord not of their own. They keep their own counsel in all things.\n\nBut perhaps a wise and cunning lord of men - and what else is the ruler of Dorwinion - may convince them that to support his cause in war against the realms enemies, furthers also their own goal of remaining unmolested and alone in their forest homes, that to do so would ensure no mannish intrusions into their secret places? If such an accord could be reached, these elven warriors would bring the might of the refusers to the battle, and though their armor may be light, and their weapon-craft less sophisticated than that of the Noldor - these Elves make up for it in wildness and ferocity.\n\nThe Avari were never tempered by the gentle touch of Illuvatars children, and it shows. They wage war with a merciless obsession, firing vicious barbed arrows and then closing in with terrible, cleaver-like elven swords.

{Lindar}Lindar
{Lindar_desc}Like the Sindar, the Lindar were of Telerin origin. In fact, the native name of the Teleri was, in their own tongue, Lindai. It was during the Great March that they were given the name Teleri by the Ñoldor. Teleri means 'those at the end of the line' or 'the hindmost', and that nickname stuck. When the Telerin host reached the Hithaeglir - the Misty Mountains - a large number of them were unwilling to go further, being afraid of crossing the menacing mountains, which were indeed Morgoth's creation, raised there to hinder the Valar and especially Oromë in making contact with the Eldar. While pondering on their course, they came to love the beauty of the Vale of Anduin, and in the end they abandoned the Great March altogether and settled there permanently. Nandor they were called by the Ñoldor in later years, but they called themselves by their old name, save in a new form - Lindi. Eventually, after many years of peace had passed, they split again when a large group led by Denethor headed off to the south and west, and after many long years crossed the Ered Luin and finally entered Beleriand, where they settled in a place they named Ossiriand (Land of Seven Rivers) under the shadow of the Blue Mountains. These Elves were from then on known as the Lindar, and their realm was called Lindon.

{Noldor}Ñoldo
{Noldor_desc}The Ñoldor are the second of the three Eldar hosts who departed from Cuiviénen - the Waters of Awakening - and took part in the Great March to Aman. They were led by Finwë, first High King of all Ñoldor, and after a long trip they finally reached the Blessed Realm. Their residence was Tirion on the hill of Túna which lay in the Calaciryan - The Pass of Light. Since all of the Ñoldor who returned to Middle-earth had been followers of Fëanor in his Exile, they all were considered rebels against Manwë and the other Valar and therefore fell under the Doom of Mandos. Thus, they were forbidden to return to Valinor till they had repented and pleaded for forgiveness. Those who survived the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age were finally forgiven and allowed to return to the Blessed Realm. There were many though who did not wish to return, or were not granted forgiveness by the Valar yet because of their key roles in the rebellion. These Elves instead established new realms in Lindon and Eregion, and took Gil-galad, son of Orodreth, son of Angrod and direct descendant of King Finwë, as their High King. Gil-galad perished heroically during the Battle of the Last Alliance in Second Age 3441, when he faced Sauron in a duel. Even though they are now a dwindling people, the Ñoldor are still the most powerful and wise of the remaining Elves in Middle-earth.

{Sindar_desc}The Sindar are of Telerin origin. The Teleri were the third and largest host of the Eldar who decided to follow the invitation of the Valar and go to Valinor. During the Great March, groups of the Teleri, both small and large, abandoned the main host and therefore never reached Aman, and never set their eyes upon the sacred light of the Two Trees - Telperion and Laurelin. The last separation of the Teleri took place in Beleriand, when Elwë Singollo, who together with his brother Olwë led the Teleri on the Great March, got lost while wandering in Nan Elmoth - a great forest within which he met Melian the Maia and was enchanted by her song. Long did his kin search for Elwë, but found him not. At last his brother Olwë lost hope and decided to follow the Vanyar and the Ñoldor, who had recently departed from Beleriand and were on their way to Valinor. Those who wanted to continue the search for Elwë and were not willing to leave Middle-earth without him stayed behind and kept looking for him in vain. When at last Elwë returned to them, they hailed him as their King. Taking Melian as his Queen, with whom he had grown to share a bond of love, he and his people established the realm of Doriath, and dwelt there as a distinct people. They called themselves Sindar.

{House_Amdir}House of Amdír
{House_Amdir_desc}Amdír was a noble Sinda of Doriath, member of the Fellowship of Nine and hence a companion of Oropher. He settled in Lórien and there established the Realm of Lothlórien or Lórinand in the tongue of the Nandor. Amdír suffered the same fate as Oropher, he was slain in the Battle of Dagorlad in Second Age 3434. His son Amroth became King of Lothlórien and after the end of the War of the Last Alliance returned with the remnants of his army to Lórien. Around Third Age 2050 Amroth drowned in the Bay of Belfalas. After his death the Kingship of Lothlórien was vacant and his folk - the Galadhrim - took Celeborn and Galadriel for ruling Lord and Lady.

{House_Cirdan}House of Círdan
{House_Cirdan_desc}Círdan, a Sindarin nickname meaning the Shipwright, is a Teleri and his real name in Telerin was Nōwē. He was among the highest Telerin Lords who stayed in Middle-earth and akin to Olwë and thus also akin to Elwë and Elmo. When Olwë left Beleriand with those of the Teleri who were eager to reach Valinor, Círdan remained and made his home at the coasts of Belegaer – the Sundering Sea. His people, though belonging to the Sindar, became a folk apart and were called Falathrim, which is Sindarin for the people of the foaming shore. Círdan himself apparently wanted to reach the Blessed Realm and thought of ships to achieve his desire. But he received a direct message from the Valar 'Abide now that time, for when it comes then will your work be of utmost worth, and it will be remembered in song for many ages after.'. He obeyed and still lives in Mithlond. Being among the Eldar who decided to depart from Cuiviénen he thus is the oldest Elf in Middle-earth and he will be the last of all Elves to leave it!

They are granted a unique fate, they have the Life of Elves as long as their father remains in Middle-earth, but if Elrond departs from it, they have to follow him in order to keep the fate of the Elves, which is to be immortal within the Life of Arda, which has a certain though unknown limit and ends with the end of time

{House_Elwe_desc}The House of Elwë was the ruling royal House of all the Sindar. High King Elwë Singollo, Elu Thingol in Sindarin, was slain by Dwarves during the first Sack of Doriath in First Age 503. Elwë had two brethren, Olwë and Elmo. While Olwë at last led those of the host of the Teleri who were eager to see the light of the Trees, Telperion and Laurelin, to Valinor, Elmo stayed in Beleriand with the remaining Teleri searching for Elwë. Elmo did not survive the First Age, but his grandson Celeborn, son of Galadhon did. He never forgave the Dwarves their part in the Ruin of Doriath. In Celeborn and his descendants a branch line of Elwë's House lives till today.

{House_Finarfin}House of Finarfin
{House_Finarfin_desc}Finarfin was the last son of Finwë and he was the most gentle and noble minded one of them. He married Eärwen, Olwë of Alqualondë’s daughter, and thus his children were akin to Elwë. Three sons he had, Finrod, Angrod and Aikanár and one daughter, Galadriel. Finarfin led the third host of the Ñoldor on their way into exile, but his House and his followers fought against the hosts of Fëanor and Fingolfin during the First Kinslaying, thus defending their mother’s kin and the Teleri in Alqualondë. When Mandos declared the Doom of Fëanor, Finarfin repented and led many of his host back to Valinor, where the Valar granted them forgiveness. He lives there still and rules the Ñoldor in Tirion upon Túna. But all his children along with the rest of his folk and kin continued their march to Middle-earth and thus fell under the Doom of Mandos. Of his children all vanished in the First Age but Galadriel, who is still alive and dwells together with her husband Celeborn in Lórien.

{House_Fingolfin}House of Fingolfin
{House_Fingolfin_desc}After the birth of Fëanor his mother Míriel forsook bodily Life. Her fëa, which is spirit in Quenya, left her hröa - body - which she laid down in Lórien and travelled to Mandos. This was a thing strange to both Eldar and Valar and had never happened before. Finwë was grieved and long tended his wife's body, but after some years went to Lorien no more. As the years passed by it came to pass that Finwë was eager to take a new wife. This also was a thing unknown and strange to the Eldar, because they marry but once and for all! Therefore he sought the council of Manwë and after long deliberation among the Valar, a statute was made and declared Doom by Mandos. Now Finwë was free to take a new spouse and his second wife was Indis, sister of Ingwë the King of the Vanyar. She bore him four children, Findis, Fingolfin, Irimë and Finarfin. Fingolfin the eldest son of these five followed Fëanor into exile leading the second host of the rebelling Ñoldor. During the Dagor Bragollach - the Battle of the Sudden Flame - in First Age 455 Fingolfin faced Morgoth himself, challenging him to a duel, seven times he wounded Morgoth with Ringil, his sword, but at last he was overcome.

{House_Oropher_desc}Oropher was a noble Sindar of Doriath. After the Ruin of Doriath and the end of the First Age, he gathered eight companions and led them east across the Ered Luin. This Fellowship of the Nine, as it was later called, eventually reached Greenwood the Great, and there they were welcomed by the Nandor, whom they perceived as being of close kin. Due to their superior knowledge and wisdom, the nine nobles soon became Lords of the Nandor and Oropher, their leader, became King. In Second Age 3434, he fell with two-thirds of his army in the Battle of the Dagorlad, before the Black Gates. After the War of the Last Alliance was over and Sauron was overthrown, only a mere third of Oropher's host returned to their realm. They were led by King Thranduil, Oropher's son, who is their King still.

{LindarAdmiral}Linda
{LindarAdmiral_desc}Like the Sindar, the Lindar were of Telerin origin. In fact, the native name of the Teleri was, in their own tongue, Lindai. It was during the Great March that they were given the name Teleri by the Ñoldor. Teleri means 'those at the end of the line' or 'the hindmost', and that nickname stuck. When the Telerin host reached the Hithaeglir - the Misty Mountains - a large number of them were unwilling to go further, being afraid of crossing the menacing mountains, which were indeed Morgoth's creation, raised there to hinder the Valar and especially Oromë in making contact with the Eldar. While pondering on their course, they came to love the beauty of the Vale of Anduin, and in the end they abandoned the Great March altogether and settled there permanently. Nandor they were called by the Ñoldor in later years, but they called themselves by their old name, save in a new form - Lindi. Eventually, after many years of peace had passed, they split again when a large group led by Denethor headed off to the south and west, and after many long years crossed the Ered Luin and finally entered Beleriand, where they settled in a place they named Ossiriand (Land of Seven Rivers) under the shadow of the Blue Mountains. These Elves were from then on known as the Lindar, and their realm was called Lindon.

The few who who have made contact with these outlanders describe them as uncouth barbarians living in a harsh snow-locked land. The learned amongst the Dunedain remember them mostly because of one visit by the ill-fortuned Arvedui (whose fate came in large part from underestimating them and thus ignoring their advice), and the later visit by the Dúnedain to reclaim the Ring of Barahir. In the waning years of the Third Age, some hardy merchants come as far as the southern edges of their lands to trade for salt, furs, bead-work, carvings in bone and antler, and other rare goods. While they welcome this rare oppurtunity at trade, they are eager to see these 'southern guests' leave them to their cherished isolation from the troubles and woes of Middle-earth.

{Harondor}Man of Harondor
{Harondor_desc}South Gondor, known in Sindarin as Harondor, is a disputed region between the rivers Poros and Harnen. Historically this region was a part of Gondor, but frequent assaults and invasions by the Corsairs of Umbar and the Haradrim meant that, by the later years of the Third Age, Gondor's rule over this region was limited and the men of Harondor began to carve out their own small fiefs and kingdoms.

{NoldorDiplomat}Ñoldo
{NoldorDiplomat_desc}The Ñoldor are the second of the three Eldar hosts who departed from Cuiviénen - the Waters of Awakening - and took part in the Great March to Aman. They were led by Finwë, first High King of all Ñoldor, and after a long trip they finally reached the Blessed Realm. Their residence was Tirion on the hill of Túna which lay in the Calaciryan - The Pass of Light. Since all of the Ñoldor who returned to Middle-earth had been followers of Fëanor in his Exile, they all were considered rebels against Manwë and the other Valar and therefore fell under the Doom of Mandos. Thus, they were forbidden to return to Valinor till they had repented and pleaded for forgiveness. Those who survived the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age were finally forgiven and allowed to return to the Blessed Realm. There were many though who did not wish to return, or were not granted forgiveness by the Valar yet because of their key roles in the rebellion. These Elves instead established new realms in Lindon and Eregion, and took Gil-galad, son of Orodreth, son of Angrod and direct descendant of King Finwë, as their High King. Gil-galad perished heroically during the Battle of the Last Alliance in Second Age 3441, when he faced Sauron in a duel. Even though they are now a dwindling people, the Ñoldor are still the most powerful and wise of the remaining Elves in Middle-earth.

{LindarSpy}Linda
{LindarSpy_desc}Like the Sindar, the Lindar were of Telerin origin. In fact, the native name of the Teleri was, in their own tongue, Lindai. It was during the Great March that they were given the name Teleri by the Ñoldor. Teleri means 'those at the end of the line' or 'the hindmost', and that nickname stuck. When the Telerin host reached the Hithaeglir - the Misty Mountains - a large number of them were unwilling to go further, being afraid of crossing the menacing mountains, which were indeed Morgoth's creation, raised there to hinder the Valar and especially Oromë in making contact with the Eldar. While pondering on their course, they came to love the beauty of the Vale of Anduin, and in the end they abandoned the Great March altogether and settled there permanently. Nandor they were called by the Ñoldor in later years, but they called themselves by their old name, save in a new form - Lindi. Eventually, after many years of peace had passed, they split again when a large group led by Denethor headed off to the south and west, and after many long years crossed the Ered Luin and finally entered Beleriand, where they settled in a place they named Ossiriand (Land of Seven Rivers) under the shadow of the Blue Mountains. These Elves were from then on known as the Lindar, and their realm was called Lindon.

{LivedAges}Lived for Ages
{LivedAges_desc}Elven lives are long. They are destined to live as long as Arda and therefore time exists. Every Elf consists out of two things, the soul or spirit, which is fëa in Quenya, and the body - which is hröa in Quenya. While the hröa is made out of the physical matter of Arda - which is hrón in Quenya -, the fëa derives direct from Eru Ilúvatar. In an Arda without Melkor the Life of the fëa within his hröa would be in harmony and without diminishing till the end of time. But since Melkor marred all the matter of Arda, if not Eä - with the remarkable exception of the hrón of Valinor - , and because all hröar are made out of this hrón the hröa of every Elf is liable to the marring and his hröa dwindles. Albeit the process of dwindling is a slow one and although the fëa of an Elf is always the dominant part, it is not however stoppable in Middle-earth or even Arda. It can only be avoided by departing Middle-earth and reaching the Blessed Realm of Valinor.

His fëa, his soul or spirit, returned to the Halls of Waiting and there was judged by Mandos. After receiving the Vala's forgiveness for his part in the rebellion of the Ñoldor, he was released from Mandos and then restored to a new hröa - body - by Manwë. He thereafter dwelt in Valinor till around Second Age 1200, when he was sent back to Middle-earth to assist Gil-galad against Sauron. Glorfindel is the most powerful Elf currently alive in all of Middle-earth.

The chief of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain is greatly versed in crafting and, after years of research, has found the secret of the making of Rings of Power. They aren't as powerful of the ones made by Celebrimbor, but they are free from the influence of the One Ring and will be useful against the power of the Enemy.

{Gwathredir}Biography
{Gwathredir_desc}What little is known of Hervail, even less is known of Gwathredir. The men of Dorwinion know well enough to not enter the Mountains of Mithrin - for none return. Until soemthing changes, it's likely the Avari and their Elders will remain shrouded in mystery.

{Hervail}Biography
{Hervail_desc}Little is known of Hervail, Elder of the Avari "native" to the forests of Dorwinion. The little information that has been gleaned is that they are likely distant cousins of those who dwell in the Mountains of Mithrin. Who takes commands from who, if there is even any heriarchy, is unknown. Hervail and his people have not been treatied with since the days of Hawin's ancestors and any knowledge that might have been passed down was long forgotten.
